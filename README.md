# python-challenge

Solved PyBank except total amount is missing the first row value. The objective was to remove the first amount value from the amount change calulation. unfortunately I was unable to find a better way of achieving that 

Had difficulty with PyPoll. I planned to use dictionaries to calculate the percentage votes per candidate, however was unable to execute.
